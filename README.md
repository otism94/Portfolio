# Portfolio
My portfolio website for the Netmatters SCS course.

## Dependencies
- PHPMailer

## Dev Dependencies
Details in `package.json`. Currently unused in this build.
- Rollup
- Babel

## Known Issues
- [ ] Contact form isn't working on the live site (pending server-specific configurations). The error message it gives also messes with the layout a bit.
- [ ] Navbar is hidden in the smallest viewport. This will be resolved when I implement JavaScript.
